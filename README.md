# stock_market_txt

Listen. is this the most advanced program in the world? no. Is it exceptionally hard to code? also no. Is it the best example of my abilities? Probably not, but, it's Java and I enjoy java.
It is a little proof that I can do more than just front-end html and CSS, though, as that's what is mostly pinned on this github page.

run using ```javac OlivaAssignment1.java``` and then ```java OlivaAssignment1 StockmarketInputTesting.txt```. You can create your own text file if you want, but you'd have to adhere to the format of the original testing file, which has like 9 things on one line for hundreds of lines. anyways. like i said, not the best program ever
